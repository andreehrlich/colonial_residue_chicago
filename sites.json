The bridge, considered an engineering marvel of its time, was built in 1920 as part of the Burnham Plan of 1909, which recommended that Michigan Avenue be widened and extended further north of the river.  The bridge\u2019s Beaux Arts was designed by Thomas Pihlfeldt, Hugh Young and the co-author of the Plan of Chicago Edward Bennett to resemble the Alexander III Bridge over the Seine in Paris. \nLike most trunnion bascule bridges over the Chicago River, the DuSable Bridge is movable, which allows boats to pass underneath. It moves when the counterweights lift by rotating around large, fixed axles called trunnions. The massive underground counterbalances the bridge\u2019s leaves and allow small 108 horsepower motors to open and close the bridge. In the 1920s, the DuSable Bridge would lift more than 3,000 times a year.  Today, to minimize disruptions to traffic on the Magnificent Mile, it only opens 40 times a year. \nDuSable\u2019s two double-deck leaves carry both Michigan Avenue and a lower-level service road over the river, allowing for two levels of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. When the bridge was first constructed, it was said to be the only double-deck bridge built with highways on both levels.  DuSable has indeed become a much-used connection between Chicago\u2019s north and south as the construction of the bridge led to the rapid development of North Michigan or what Arthur Rubloff would call the Magnificent Mile in 1947. Today, thousands of people cross the bridge daily.  \nThe location of this bridge is also significant in the early history of Chicago. In 1928 sculptures depicting scenes from Chicago's history were added to the outward-facing walls of the four bridge houses. The sculptures on the northern bridge houses were commissioned by William Wrigley, Jr., and are by James Earle Fraser: The Discoverers depicts the arrival of French explorers James Marquette and Louis Joliet, The Pioneers depicts the first settlers, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and John Kinzie. The sculptures on the southern bridge houses were commissioned by the Benjamin F. Ferguson Monument Fund and are by Henry Hering: Defense depicts Ensign George Ronan in a scene from the 1812 Battle of Fort Dearborn (the southern end of the bridge neighbors the original Fort Dearborn site); Regeneration depicts workers rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The bridge, along with its bridge houses, was designated a Chicago Landmark in 1991 by the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois.  \nIn 2010, the bridge was officially renamed DuSable Bridge in honor of Chicago\u2019s first permanent resident, Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable, whose homesite abuts the northern end of the bridge. There are no records of Point du Sable's life prior to the 1770s.  Although it is known from sources during his life that he was a fur trader of African and French- Canadian descent who married into the Native American Potawatomi tribe. He established a permanent homestead and trading post near the mouth of the Chicago River in the 1780s. A historical novel published in 1953 helped to popularize the commonly recited claim that he was born in 1745 in Saint-Marc in Saint-Domingue, Haiti.  During his career, the areas where he settled and traded around the Great Lakes and in the Illinois Country changed hands several times among France, Britain, Spain and the new United States. In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, he was arrested by the British military on suspicion of being an American sympathizer.

Many do not know that it was named not for this shape but for the junction between the Dan Ryan, Kennedy, and Eisenhower expressways - the Circle Interchange - functioning as a nod to Chicago\u2019s infrastructure and history. Part of its design included an eight-foot-tall brick wall and metal fence surrounding the perimeter of the campus, separating it from the neighborhood and leading to its nickname \u201cFortress Illini.\u201d Many students and faculty found the enclosed nature of the campus harsh and alienating - and this was the least of the campus\u2019s problems (UIC Library Archives, 2015).\n\tThe area allocated for the construction of the Circle Campus, a 106-acre parcel of land at the junction of the Little Italy and Greektown neighborhoods, was determined by Chicago\u2019s City Council. However, nearly 5,000 Latinx Americans called the junction home. Hundreds of protestors, shouting \u201c[Mayor Richard J.] Daley sold us out\u201d and \u201cRespeten nuestros hogares\u201d (Respect our homes), fought against the city\u2019s plans to raze their homes and build the university, but they were unsuccessful. As a result, many in Chicago\u2019s working-class Latinx community, who had been living in the area since their immigration in the 1920s, were forced out of their homes. Some moved west and south, where they were further displaced by additional expansions, and many ended up in the Pilsen and Little Village areas, where much of Chicago\u2019s Latinx population lives today (Mitchell, 2014). This space represents neither the beginning nor the end of the mistreatment of Chicago\u2019s working class Latinx population but rather one example of the displacement of communities of color due to hegemonic sociopolitical structures. \n\tThe University of Illinois and its history is one of many white supremacist university institutions forcing their presence into the lives of marginalized peoples of color. Their building represents a lack of concern for the physical space they take up, creating an undue burden on the lives of immigrants to the extent that they must uproot their entire lives without warning or an opportunity for self-determination. This story, however, also represents a deeper lack of awareness of the oppressive structural power that many predominantly white universities claim to seek to understand and check. Although some attempts to \u201cdecolonize education\u201d have been met with administrative support, as with universities such as Cambridge (Kennedy, 2017), most institutions still prioritize their prestige over their impact on nonwhite communities. The University of Illinois, specifically, does not recognize its positionality or imperialist history, especially in relationship to its Latinx students and Chicago\u2019s Latinx community overall. Nowhere in their history do they acknowledge the community they displaced to build their campus (UIC Library Archives, 2015). In addition, although almost a quarter of the college\u2019s students are Latinx, only a handful of faculty are also Latinx, and they are still fighting for more faculty representation and research on issues relevant to their community (Serrato, 2017).\n", "img": "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OYnXwvxIO4aLyth5FOPE-kTox0UfyuDW", "investigator": "Jade Davis", "longitude": 41.87483585, "address": "1200 W Harrison St, Chicago, IL 60607", "latitude": -87.6582766149508, "name": "University of Illinois at Chicago Circle Campus"}}, {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-87.6189497222932, 41.8757965]}, "type": "Feature", "properties": {"description": "The site I chose to map were the rose gardens that enclose Buckingham Fountain in Chicago, Illinois. Buckingham is the centerpiece of the 500-acre Grant Park and beloved and visited by many. The Buckingham\u2019s themselves were a prominent family with political ties in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th century. Clarence Buckingham was an art patron and the director of the Art Institute for more than a decade, and funded much of the museum\u2019s colonial collection\u2019s maintenance and expansion. With his unexpected death in 1913, his sister Kate Buckingham gifted the city of Chicago a sum of money to construct and maintain a magnificent fountain as a permanent memorial to her brother. Buckingham Fountain itself holds a deep colonial residue, as Clarence Buckingham, who was lauded by many for his cosmopolitanism and appreciation of the arts was in fact moving around large sums of money to bring cultural artifacts, sacred pieces of history, and jewels that were pillaged from looted communities in the Global South into Chicago. The fountain  is enclosed by two extravagant rose gardens on the north and south ends.\nDespite occupying indigenous land -- Chicago was and is home to Potawatomie, Ojibwa, Odawa, Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk tribes -- green spaces in Chicago too often reflect a colonial history. Colonists spread their culture to the New World, through both ideology and invasive species, which occurred intentionally and unintentionally. Roses were brought over from Europe as they were understood to be civilized and beautiful. They represented an aestheticized form of beauty that was tamed and manufactured, and quickly began to dominate landscapes where indigenous plants and flowers were grown. This preoccupation with roses rather than plants that are indigenous to the soil of Chicago, such as sweetgrass, sage, or tobacco, are a part of the colonial legacy of erasing culture, pulling it out from its roots, and planting the colonial one in place. \nRoses hold a uniquely capitalist position in our contemporary moment as well. Roses have turned into a commodity rather than a plant and something that has to be nurtured in order to blossom and grow; they are bought rather than cultivated and contribute to the deep separation of individuals from the land. The land thus isn\u2019t something you care for and something that cares for you, but rather something that is used as commodity and for consumer needs. Green spaces in Chicago move away from providing individuals with a connection to the Earth thus, and rather are entirely contrived and a part of the industrial capitalist project which is subsequently a part of and deeply related to the larger structural colonizing project. \nUltimately, although the rose gardens at the Buckingham Fountain are a convenient, fragrant, and aesthetically pleasing place to rest, sit, or eat lunch, it remains critical to interrogate their history, and to examine why we constantly remain fixated with and adhere to Eurocentric and Western standards of beauty, in the most subtle yet visceral spaces, like gardens.

The park as a whole contains two apparent ties to coloniality: first, the park, previously known as Lake Park and South Park, was later named after President Andrew Jackson. Second, the World\u2019s Columbian Exhibition was the World\u2019s Fair that commemorated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019s arrival to America. One way that the fair incorporated this was by displaying life-sized models of the three ships (Nina, Pinta, Santa Maria), constructed in Spain and brought to America by sea as a collaboration between the two countries. Aside from these two rather nominal ties to colonialism, the fair\u2019s construction was arguably most consequential in creating colonial residue. The fair\u2019s architecture was mostly in the neoclassical style and came to be known as the \u201cWhite City,\u201d with the intention of creating grand, white architecture. This \u201cbeautification\u201d process came to be known as the \u201cCity Beautiful,\u201d which influenced many other American cities after the World\u2019s Columbian Exhibition. Thus, despite the fact that much of the architecture of Jackson Park burned down in the Chicago Fire, the World\u2019s Columbian Exhibition and Jackson Park holds colonial residue of both hosting the fair as well as leading to the spread of other city beautification or \u201curban renewal\u201d processes, many of which had the aim of replacing \u201cslum communities\u201d through aesthetics rather than social policy. For example, in Chicago, urban renewal projects in Hyde Park in the 1940s through 1970s \u201credeveloped\u201d the area by seizing properties and demolishing public housing projects in order to use the land for commercial property or housing for wealthier families. The emphasis on aesthetics over social policy to revitalize inner cities is particularly evident in the fact that the White City was constructed through architecture that was largely meant to be temporary and for the spectacle of the World\u2019s Fair, paralleling the idea that \u201cbeautifying\u201d a city in order to attract economic development or international interest is a shallow way of concealing rather than solving structural problems such as poverty. The movement also was based in values of \u201cmorality\u201d and \u201cvirtue\u201d to be imposed on the cities\u2019 \u201curban\u201d populations. This residue continues today, with Jackson Park being flagged as the potential future site of the Obama Presidential Center, which is controversial because while some support it as a potential source of economic development, others criticize it for its potential to act as a gentrifying force in an area that has historically been subject to gentrification and urban renewal projects associated with the University of Chicago. Preservationist groups have also criticized the site for the harm it would cause to the plantlife of the park, and the nonprofit Friends of the Park filed a lawsuit to prevent the construction of the Center.

This mural is found on the side of a grocery store, and it references the history of Argyle (and Uptown) in 5 phases: from 1900 - 1940, we see immigrants from Appalachia enter through two doorways; from 1940 - 1960, we see African Americans jazz musicians walk through the doorway past a woman sitting at a table with a sign saying \u201cEqual Education for All\u201d. This references the Great Migration north to escape segregation and Jim Crow laws. In between 1960-1980, a Black musician sits in the doorway, and in the 1980-2000 doorway, we see a Vietnamese couple cross the threshold. There is also a Native American man in the mural, and some movie cameras in the scene (Uptown had a strong entertainment industry in the 20\u2019s).  \n \nI already knew that gentrification was an issue in Uptown- this neighborhood has been an entryway for historically poor immigrants (Appalachia, Blacks, Asians\u2026), and now, as it is popularizing, residents are being economically displaced. I was wondering, though, where some of the people in the mural had gone, and if some of the displacement had been done by this newest wave of Asian immigrants. For example, why was the Native American man painted in the mural? What happened to the Native Americans in Uptown?\n\nSome history about that: after the Indian Relocation act (in 1956- which was wildly recent\u2026), many Natives moved to Chicago because it was named as a place that had opportunities for Natives. In Uptown, on Wilson Av, the American Indian Center was founded to provide social support for the influx of Natives. (Interestingly enough, these streets were named \u2018Hillbilly Heaven and Redskin Row\u2019 because of the numbers of poor whites (probably from Appalachia and Natives concentrated here). The AIC is now in Kimball, primarily to better serve a more dispersed Native population in Chicago. \n\n\u201cUptown lost 269 of its 652 Native American residents between 1990 and 2000, according to the census\u2026.\n\nSome American Indian leaders say the census doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the size of their community because many residents don\u2019t fill out census forms.

He was responsible for meticulously recording the Vodun practices in Haiti in the 1930s, and this record was the most comprehensive of its time, and he also did various research projects around Brazil whose objectives were to trace the abolition of slavery in the country. He is also responsible for developing certain concepts in anthropology in relation to the study of non-western cultures, one of them being the concept of race as a sociological concept as opposed to a biological one. He also aided in developing the concept of cultural relativism which posits that the development of African- American culture came from the interaction of African cultures of the slaves with the Western material environment (read culture) upon which they were thrust upon. In summary, cultural relativism within the context of African-American culture posits that African-American culture did not come about as a result of the elevation of African cultures due to its proximity to Western culture (This notion was notoriously prevalent at the time) but instead, it came about as a hybrid culture exhibited by the slaves in an attempt to cope with their Western environment.\nIn addition to writing works on the African and African-American experience, he was a professor at Northwestern University and it was in this institution that he founded the Program of African Studies, and he was its first chair. During the Cold war, he was called by the U.S. Government to advise on matters of the African continent. He was openly against the use of African countries as objects of political strategy by their colonial governments, and was for the countries attaining their independence from colonial government.

The bust has inhabited numerous locations over the years \u2013 a gift to the university from Evans himself in 1893, it has moved from the Orrington Lunt Library to Deering Library to its current home at the alumni center. John Evans played an integral role in the creation of Northwestern\u2013 he was the original owner of the land in Evanston and Chicago on which the school was built, refusing to allow the school to sell the land on numerous occasions. His founding of Northwestern and his leadership in the Northwest Territory led to the surrounding city of Evanston to be named after him. Evans was appointed Governor of Colorado as settlers were first colonizing the region, a decade after Northwestern\u2019s creation. On November 29, 1864, over 800 troops of the Third Colorado Cavalry attacked a settlement of Arapaho and Cheyenne Native Americans located near Sand Creek, Colorado in an event now known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Despite raising flags of surrender, approximately 160 Native Americans were killed through appalling means. Most of those killed were women and children, as well as eleven chiefs who previously had a positive relationship with the Federal Government. The massacre had a lasting negative impact on relations between settlers, Federal and state governments, and Native Americans. The massacre was led by Colonel Chivington, one of Evans\u2019 friends and associates. Although Evans was not directly involved in the Sand Creek Massacre itself, Evans\u2019 previous actions as governor enabled Colorado settlers to take deadly action against Native Americans in the region \u2013 rather than attempting to ease tension between the opposing groups, Evans facilitated greater violence to take place. As a response to settler demands, Evans introduced a proclamation in August of 1864 encouraging Coloradans to \u201ckill and destroy, as enemies of the country, wherever they may be found, all [\u2026] hostile Indians\u201d without plans for differentiating friend from foe. Native Americans later approached Evans for peace negotiations, but Evans declined to help despite his ability to do so, claiming that Native Americans had not suffered enough for their misdeeds.
