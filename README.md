"This course is designed as a starting point to explore, examine and define the terms: Post-Colonialism and Decolonization. We will begin with introductory texts and resources to outline and familiarize ourselves with the terms associated with these concepts. The writings of Edward Said, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Homi Bhabha will be centered. Particular attention will be paid to the interplay of post-colonialism/decolonization and issues of race, gender, class, feminism and sexuality. Questions concerning hegemony, sovereignty, freedom and oppression of indigenous peoples will be examined with case studies from African, Caribbean, Asian and North American contexts."

"The history of colonial rule continues to affect and shape the ways we live today. As such, how we define and navigate processes of post-colonialism/decolonization is critical to issues as wide ranging as international cooperation; contemporary art practice; and any engagement we may have with cultural, historic or political institutions."

"Through substantive analysis of course readings; creative workshops; presentations; guest lecturers; and viewings of art and film, students will develop the skills to make theoretical arguments and consider ways to define these complex terms. Students will begin to develop the skills to examine how these terms relate to their own lives and creative practices."
